this is my master thesis on the extension of the mulit-level _hp_ finite cell method to for thermo-viscoplastic problems using an advanced numerical integration strategy to increase the computational efficiency. along with the thesis you can find the slides of a talk I gave at the wccm conference 2024 on the same topic (in english and a similar german version as well).
